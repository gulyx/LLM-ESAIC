When a GLP-1 (i.e., glucagon-like peptide 1) agonist is prescribed as a weekly injection and considering the long half-life of GLP-1 agonists, we recommend pausing GLP-1 agonists at least 1 week before a scheduled procedure requiring sedation/anaesthesia. If these drugs are given for obesity, then 2 weeks (three half-lives) are recommended. (GRADE: 3A)
