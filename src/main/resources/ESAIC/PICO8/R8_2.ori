We recommend continuing antiplatelet therapy for 6 months after elective percutaneous intervention and 12 months after an urgent coronary intervention. In the case of drug-coated balloon angioplasty, the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy could vary from a minimum of 1 month to a maximum of 12 months, depending on the status of the disease (stable vs. unstable, chronic vs. acute), the dimension of the occluded vessel, presence of in-stent restenosis, type of stenosed stent and bleeding risk.
