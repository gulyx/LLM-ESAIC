We discourage using METs as a subjective measurement of the patient's functional capacity before medical decision-making. The preoperative patient-subjective estimate of METs correlates poorly with the METs measured by exercise stress testing. Nonetheless, in selected individuals, the preoperative assessment of patient-subjective METs is used as a surrogate marker of preoperative performance even if this is not seen as a substitute for preoperative cardiopulmonary testing.
