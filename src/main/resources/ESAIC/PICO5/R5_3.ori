We suggest that patients admitted for hospital care with a previous clinical–radiological diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection that required intensive care unit or high dependency unit admission should go through more extensive cardiorespiratory preoperative evaluation (e.g., echocardiography, chest computed tomography, cardiopulmonary exercise testing a.k.a. CPET). (GRADE: CPS)
