We do not recommend routine admission to the ICU (i.e., Intensive Care Unit) for patients with stable cardiac diseases undergoing elective major surgery. Selective access to the ICU in this subset of patients following a multidisciplinary evaluation of the risk-to-benefit ratio might be more appropriate. (GRADE: 1C)
