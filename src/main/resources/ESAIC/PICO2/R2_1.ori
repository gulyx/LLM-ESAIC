We suggest referral to a specialist (e.g., cardiologist, pneumologist, allergologist) to make an accurate diagnosis and, if the patient's underlying condition can be improved, to set out a time scale and treatment regimen to obtain this improvement. Only at the end of this process, when the patient is "optimised", can the anaesthetist make a prediction or an estimate of the risk. (GRADE: CPS)
