We suggest referral to a specialist (cardiologist, pneumologist, allergologist, etc.) to make an accurate diagnosis and, if the patient's underlying condition can be improved, to set out a time scale and treatment regimen to obtain this improvement. Only at the end of this process, when the patient is ‘optimised', can the anaesthetist make a prediction/estimate of the risk. (GRADE: CPS))
