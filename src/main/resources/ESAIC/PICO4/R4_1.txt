We suggest using a focused POCUS (i.e., Point-of-Care Ultrasound) examination of the heart and lung, performed by a trained anaesthetist, in patients with any concerns regarding cardiovascular comorbidity before urgent or emergency surgery to address significant cardiac abnormalities and request a cardiology consultation and trigger more thorough cardiovascular monitoring, but it should not delay surgery.
